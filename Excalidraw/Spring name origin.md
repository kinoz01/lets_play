The name "Spring" for the Java framework was suggested by co-founder Yann Caroff for two main reasons:

- A *"fresh start" from older Java technologies*: The name symbolized a new beginning or a "spring" after the perceived "winter" of traditional, complex J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) development. The Spring Framework aimed to simplify enterprise Java development by using "plain old Java objects" (POJOs) and dependency injection.
- *Association with nature*: Caroff was also aware of creator Rod Johnson's love for nature and his trek to Everest Base Camp, leading to the seasonal association. 

The name "Spring" is often used alone to refer to the entire family of projects, while "Java Spring" is a common way to specify the platform, as Spring is the most popular framework for Java.
